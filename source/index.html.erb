<div class="bio-text" id="biography">
  <h2>Hi, I'm Charlie.</h2>
  <p>
    My experience in architecture is guided by three principles: collaboration,
    creativity, and innovation. In my five years as a college student, I have worked on
    five different projects collaborating with engineers and four different projects
    collaborating with other architects. I spend the majority of my day
    looking for ways to learn, grow, and challenge myself in every aspect of my
    life.
  </p>
  <p>
    This previous summer, I worked for Marmon Mok, an architecture firm in San Antonio,
    Texas. My time there allowed me to experience the great breadth
    of architectural work as I transitioned from working with the sports and
    recreation team to working with the Healthcare team, the Public Services
    team, and the Education team. I was in constant communication with my superiors
    and other employees, trying to learn as much
    as I could in the short span of the summer. Any trick they were willing to
    teach I was excited to pick up and learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the past four years, I have led the design of Cal Polyâ€™s Rose Parade
    Float. In my last two years on the team, I served as a coordinator between the artists, florists,
    and engineers. It was my job to make sure every team had all the information
    they needed to succesfully build the best float possible. In both of these years,
    our float was honored with the most significant award we have ever won in the Rose Parade,
    the Lathrop K Leishman Trophy for the most beautiful non-commercial float.
    To produce these award winning floats, I developed models to dictate what
    construction materials would be used, to produce accurate estimates of how many
    flowers would be needed to cover the float, and to illustrate the design and
    appearance of artistic elements on the float. Through this work I have
    gained an extensive understanding of digital modeling in every sense, as well
    as a great deal of construction experience. It has been an honor to work with
    such a dedicated, committed, and talented group of people, and I learned a ton
    along the way.
